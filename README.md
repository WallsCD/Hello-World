# Hello-World
So, I am pretty sure that this assignment is correct but, the compiler gives me the error code Hello World.java:3: error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HelloWorld.java
How do I fix this, I have done the environment path instructions and when I type javac into cmd prompt I do get the things to pop up.
I would appreciate some help, I have duty on Tuesday so before then is preferable.
